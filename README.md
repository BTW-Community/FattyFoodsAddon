# Fatty Foods Add-on
Fatty foods addon for Better Than Wolves

This is a mod for BTW that tries to re-balance the way fat works to make it more interesting throughout the game. It reworks food and fat values for all food-items, changes how and when fat gets burned, and provides new pro's and con's to having a too low or too high body fat.

## Changes include:
- Fat is always used as an energy source, no matter the balance between fat and hunger.
- Fat is always gained from food, not just when your hunger bar is full.
- Fat is dense energy, a full bar holds roughly 4 times as much energy as the hunger bar.
- Edible sugar, and a primitive way to get it using a sharp stone.
- Re-balanced food values to bring variety in specific food types.
- Different food poison chances for different types of raw food.
