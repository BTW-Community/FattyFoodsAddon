# Fatty Foods Add-on

This is a mod for BTW that tries to re-balance the way fat works to make it more interesting throughout the game. It reworks food and fat values for all food-items, changes how and when fat gets burned, and provides new pro's and con's to having a too low or too high body fat.

## Changes include:
- No matter the amount of food or fat you have, fat always tries to mitigates food drain.
- It is more effective at doing that when you don't have all that much of it.
- To counter this, the rate at which hunger drains is increased.(rate is editable in config)
- Edible sugar, and a primitive way to get it using a sharp stone.
- Re-balanced food values to bring variety in specific food types.
- Different food poison chances for different types of raw food.
- Desserts is now a food category that brings you special buffs.
- Cocoa beans and Sugar are considered the firt obtainable items of this type.
